## Random Fun Fact
A small, personal web-project for generating random fun facts to practice front-end web development.

The website has only two pages: 
1. The home page where a random fact will be displayed
2. A search page where all the facts can be found

Previously shown facts are stored in local storage and silently reset when the user has seen all the available facts. <br />
A fact can be shown by ID via URL by appending #ID to the end of the URL.
